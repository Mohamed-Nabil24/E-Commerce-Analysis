 Power BI eCommerce Dashboard: Key Insights & KPI Tracking
🚀 Just completed an exciting project where I built an eCommerce Dashboard using Power BI to analyze order trends and regional performance. Here are a few key insights I uncovered:
📉 Order Volume Drop: There was a significant 47% decrease in orders from July to August, leading me to explore possible seasonal causes.
📍 Top Performing State: California recorded the highest number of orders, highlighting a strong regional demand.
🍽️ Category Insights: The Food & Beverages category accounted for 41.21% of all orders — a clear opportunity for focused marketing and product strategy.
🧠 I used DAX to extract dynamic measures and KPIs, making the visualizations more insightful and interactive.
